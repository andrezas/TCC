1," ""What is the number of the highest-value bidding process in 2024?""","<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to find the number of the highest-value bidding process in 2024 based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user is asking for the ""number"" of the bidding process with the highest estimated value in the year 2024. So, I need to retrieve the NUMERO_LICITACAO from the LICITACAO table where the year is 2024 and the VALOR_ESTIMADO is the highest. First, I should identify the relevant columns. The table has ANO_LICITACAO which is the year, and VALOR_ESTIMADO which is the estimated value. The number of the bidding process is in NUMERO_LICITACAO. I think I can use a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter for the year 2024. Then, I need to find the maximum VALOR_ESTIMADO in that year and get the corresponding NUMERO_LICITACAO. Wait, how do I get the maximum value and the corresponding number? Maybe I can use a subquery to first find the maximum VALOR_ESTIMADO in 2024 and then select the NUMERO_LICITACAO where both the year is 2024 and the value equals that maximum. So, the subquery would be something like (SELECT MAX(VALOR_ESTIMADO) FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024). Then, the main query would select NUMERO_LICITACAO where ANO_LICITACAO is 2024 and VALOR_ESTIMADO equals that subquery result. I should also make sure that the syntax is correct for SQL Server. Using a subquery in the WHERE clause like this should work. Also, since the user wants only the number, I'll select only NUMERO_LICITACAO. Putting it all together, the query should look like: SELECT NUMERO_LICITACAO FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 AND VALOR_ESTIMADO = (SELECT MAX(VALOR_ESTIMADO) FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024) I think that should give the correct result. It selects the bidding number where the year is 2024 and the estimated value is the highest for that year. </think> SELECT NUMERO_LICITACAO FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 AND VALOR_ESTIMADO = (SELECT MAX(VALOR_ESTIMADO) FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024)",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
2," ""What is the value of the highest-value bidding process in 2023?""","<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to find the highest-value bidding process in 2023 from the provided database context. Let me start by understanding the problem and the available data. First, the question is asking for the value of the highest-value bidding process in the year 2023. So, I need to look at the data from that specific year and find the maximum value. Looking at the context, the relevant table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database under the dbo schema. The columns provided include VALOR_ESTIMADO (estimated value) and ANO_LICITACAO (year of the bidding process). I should use the VALOR_ESTIMADO column since it represents the estimated value of each bidding process. To find the highest value, I'll use the MAX() function on this column. The ANO_LICITACAO column will help filter the data to only include records from the year 2023. I need to write a SELECT statement that retrieves the maximum VALOR_ESTIMADO where ANO_LICITACAO is 2023. The SQL syntax for SQL Server should be correct, so I'll make sure to use square brackets around the column names if necessary, but in this case, the column names don't have spaces or special characters, so they might not need them. However, to be safe, I'll include them. Putting it all together, the query should select the maximum VALOR_ESTIMADO from the LICITACAO table where ANO_LICITACAO equals 2023. I should also alias the result with a meaningful name like 'HighestValue' for clarity. I should double-check the column names to ensure they're correctly spelled and that I'm using the right data types. ANO_LICITACAO is an INT, so comparing it to 2023 is appropriate. VALOR_ESTIMADO is a NUMERIC type, so using MAX() is suitable. Finally, I'll write the SQL query accordingly, ensuring it's executable in SQL Server without any errors. </think> SELECT MAX([VALOR_ESTIMADO]) AS HighestValue FROM [dbo].[LICITACAO] WHERE [ANO_LICITACAO] = 2023",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
3," ""Which organizations are responsible for the bidding processes registered in 2024?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to answer the question: ""Which organizations are responsible for the bidding processes registered in 2024?"" using the provided database context. First, I'll start by understanding the question. The user wants to know the names of the organizations responsible for the bidding processes that were registered in the year 2024. So, I need to extract the ORGAO (organization) from the LICITACAO table where the year of registration is 2024. Looking at the context, the LICITACAO table has several columns. The relevant ones here are ANO_LICITACAO, which is the year the bidding process was registered, and ORGAO, which is the organization responsible. So, the basic structure of the SQL query should select the ORGAO column from the LICITACAO table where ANO_LICITACAO equals 2024. But since the user might want each organization only once, even if they have multiple bidding processes, I should use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. Putting that together, the SQL query should be: SELECT DISTINCT ORGAO FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 I should make sure to use the correct SQL Server syntax, which this query follows. Also, since the database and schema are specified, I should include the schema in the table name, so it becomes dbo.LICITACAO. So the final query would be: SELECT DISTINCT ORGAO FROM dbo.LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 </think> SELECT DISTINCT ORGAO FROM dbo.LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
4," ""How many bidding processes were registered in 2024?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to answer the question: ""How many bidding processes were registered in 2024?"" based on the provided context. Let me break this down step by step. First, I'll look at the database and table structure. The database is LICON_DEV, and the schema is dbo. The table of interest is LICITACAO, which contains information about bidding processes. The columns provided are: - VALOR_ESTIMADO - ANO_LICITACAO - NUMERO_LICITACAO - DATA_ABERTURA - ID_MODALIDADE_LICITACAO - ID_MODALIDADE_LICITACAO_NOVA - STATUS_ANALISE - VALOR_ADJUDICADO - TIPO_ADJUDICACAO - ORGAO - ID_ENTIDADE - ID_TIPO_LICITACAO - DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO - ID_USUARIO - ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE The question is asking for the count of bidding processes registered in the year 2024. So, I need to count the number of records in the LICITACAO table where the year of registration is 2024. Looking at the columns, the most relevant one for the year is ANO_LICITACAO, which is an integer representing the year the bidding process was registered. That seems perfect for filtering the records from 2024. To count the number of records, I'll use the COUNT() function in SQL, which counts the number of rows that meet the specified criteria. Since each row represents a bidding process, counting the rows where ANO_LICITACAO is 2024 will give the desired result. So, the basic structure of the query would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024; I should also consider if there are any other columns or conditions that might affect the count, but based on the question, it's straightforwardâ€”just the count of all processes in 2024. I don't think I need to join any other tables because the question is solely about the LICITACAO table. Also, since the question is about registration, and ANO_LICITACAO directly refers to the year of registration, no date functions are needed here. If the column was a date type, I might have to extract the year, but since it's already an integer, I can directly compare it to 2024. Therefore, the SQL query should be simple and efficient, just selecting the count from the LICITACAO table where ANO_LICITACAO equals 2024. </think> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
5," ""What are the numbers of the bidding processes opened in January 2024?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to get the numbers of the bidding processes that were opened in January 2024. Let me start by understanding the problem. First, the question is asking for the numbers of the bidding processes opened in January 2024. From the context, I see that the table is named LICITACAO, and the relevant columns are NUMERO_LICITACAO for the process numbers and DATA_ABERTURA for the opening date. I remember that in SQL Server, to extract the month and year from a date, I can use the DATEPART function. So, I'll need to filter where the month is 1 (January) and the year is 2024. The basic structure of the query would be selecting NUMERO_LICITACAO from LICITACAO where the DATA_ABERTURA falls in January 2024. To get the month and year, I'll use DATEPART('MONTH', DATA_ABERTURA) = 1 and DATEPART('YEAR', DATA_ABERTURA) = 2024. I should also consider if the database uses a specific schema. From the context, the schema is dbo, so I need to include that in the table name, like dbo.LICITACAO. Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the NUMERO_LICITACAO where the DATA_ABERTURA is in January 2024. I'll make sure to use the correct syntax for SQL Server and only return the necessary column. </think> SELECT NUMERO_LICITACAO FROM dbo.LICITACAO WHERE DATEPART(MONTH, DATA_ABERTURA) = 1 AND DATEPART(YEAR, DATA_ABERTURA) = 2024",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
6," ""What was the status of the bidding process with the highest adjudicated value in 2023?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out the status of the bidding process with the highest adjudicated value in 2023. Let me start by understanding the problem. First, I know that the database is called LICON_DEV and the schema is dbo. The relevant table here is LICITACAO, which has information about the bidding processes. The columns I need to focus on are VALOR_ADJUDICADO, which is the adjudicated value, and ANO_LICITACAO, which is the year the bidding process was registered. Also, STATUS_ANALISE is the status I'm interested in. So, the goal is to find the bidding process from the year 2023 with the highest VALOR_ADJUDICADO and then get its STATUS_ANALISE. I think the best approach is to use a SQL query that selects the maximum VALOR_ADJUDICADO from LICITACAO where ANO_LICITACAO is 2023. Once I have that maximum value, I can then find the corresponding STATUS_ANALISE for that record. Wait, but what if there are multiple records with the same maximum value? In that case, I might need to handle ties, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume there's a single maximum. So, the steps are: 1. Select the maximum VALOR_ADJUDICADO where ANO_LICITACAO is 2023. 2. Use that value in a subquery to select the STATUS_ANALISE from LICITACAO where VALOR_ADJUDICADO is that maximum and ANO_LICITACAO is 2023. I should write this as a subquery. Maybe something like: SELECT STATUS_ANALISE FROM LICITACAO WHERE VALOR_ADJUDICADO = (SELECT MAX(VALOR_ADJUDICADO) FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2023) AND ANO_LICITACAO = 2023; But wait, I should make sure that the subquery is correctly structured. Also, since it's SQL Server, I need to use TOP or MAX appropriately. Alternatively, I can order the results by VALOR_ADJUDICADO in descending order and pick the top one. Another approach is to use ORDER BY and TOP 1: SELECT TOP 1 STATUS_ANALISE FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2023 ORDER BY VALOR_ADJUDICADO DESC; This might be more efficient because it directly gets the top record without a subquery. I think this is better because it's simpler and efficient. It selects the top row based on the highest VALOR_ADJUDICADO in 2023 and retrieves the STATUS_ANALISE. So, the final query would be: SELECT TOP 1 STATUS_ANALISE FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2023 ORDER BY VALOR_ADJUDICADO DESC; That should give me the status of the bidding process with the highest adjudicated value in 2023. </think> SELECT TOP 1 STATUS_ANALISE FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2023 ORDER BY VALOR_ADJUDICADO DESC;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
7," ""How many bidding processes opened in 2024 have an estimated value above 1 million reais?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking, ""How many bidding processes opened in 2024 have an estimated value above 1 million reais?"" First, I should break down the question to understand what's being asked. The user wants to count the number of bidding processes that meet two criteria: the opening year is 2024, and the estimated value is more than 1 million reais. Looking at the context provided, the relevant table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database under the dbo schema. The columns I need are ANO_LICITACAO for the year, VALOR_ESTIMADO for the estimated value, and probably NUMERO_LICITACAO to count each process, even though the count might not need it explicitly. I need to use the COUNT function to get the number of rows that meet the conditions. The WHERE clause will filter the data based on the year being 2024 and the estimated value exceeding 1,000,000. I should also consider the data types. VALOR_ESTIMADO is a NUMERIC(19,3), so comparing it to 1,000,000 should be straightforward. ANO_LICITACAO is an INT, so checking for 2024 is simple. Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the count of NUMERO_LICITACAO from the LICITACAO table where ANO_LICITACAO is 2024 and VALOR_ESTIMADO is greater than 1,000,000. I think that's all. I don't see any joins needed because the question only pertains to the LICITACAO table. So, the final query should be concise and directly address the two conditions. </think> SELECT COUNT(NUMERO_LICITACAO) AS CONTADOR_PROCESSOS FROM dbo.LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 AND VALOR_ESTIMADO > 1000000;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
8," ""Which bidding processes have the adjudication type as 'Lowest Price'?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking, ""Which bidding processes have the adjudication type as 'Lowest Price'?"" First, I should look at the provided database context. The table in question is LICITACAO, and I need to find the relevant column that relates to the adjudication type. From the columns listed, I see that TIPO_ADJUDICACAO (VARCHAR(50)) is the type of adjudication performed. That seems like the right column to use. Next, I need to filter the records where the adjudication type is 'Lowest Price'. In SQL, I can use a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause. The basic structure would be SELECT * FROM LICITACAO WHERE TIPO_ADJUDICACAO = 'Lowest Price'. But wait, sometimes column names might have spaces or special characters, so it's a good idea to enclose them in square brackets to avoid any issues. So, I'll write [TIPO_ADJUDICACAO] instead of just TIPO_ADJUDICACAO. Also, considering SQL Server's case insensitivity, but it's still good practice to match the case as in the database to prevent any unexpected issues. Putting it all together, the query should select all columns (*) from the LICITACAO table where the TIPO_ADJUDICACAO is exactly 'Lowest Price'. I think that's it. Let me double-check the syntax to make sure there are no mistakes. The schema is dbo, and the database is LICON_DEV, but since the query is within that database, I don't need to specify the schema in the FROM clause unless it's different, which it's not in this case. So the final query should be: SELECT * FROM LICITACAO WHERE [TIPO_ADJUDICACAO] = 'Lowest Price' </think> SELECT * FROM LICITACAO WHERE [TIPO_ADJUDICACAO] = 'Lowest Price'",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
9," ""What were the 5 bidding processes with the highest adjudicated values in 2024?""","<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to convert the user's question into an SQL query. The question is asking for the top 5 bidding processes with the highest adjudicated values in the year 2024. First, I'll look at the context provided. The relevant table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database under the dbo schema. The columns I need are VALOR_ADJUDICADO, which is the adjudicated value, and ANO_LICITACAO for the year. I should select these two columns because the user wants to know both the value and the year. Since the year is 2024, I'll add a WHERE clause to filter ANO_LICITACAO = 2024. To get the top 5, I'll use TOP 5 in the SELECT statement. I think ordering by VALOR_ADJUDICADO in descending order makes sense so the highest values come first. Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the top 5 records where the year is 2024, ordered by the adjudicated value from highest to lowest. I should make sure to use the correct SQL Server syntax, so I'll structure the query accordingly without any aliases unless necessary. I don't think any joins are needed here since all the required data is in the LICITACAO table. So, the final query should be straightforward, selecting the necessary columns, filtering by year, ordering, and limiting to the top 5. </think> SELECT TOP 5 VALOR_ADJUDICADO, ANO_LICITACAO FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 ORDER BY VALOR_ADJUDICADO DESC",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
10," ""What is the average estimated value of the bidding processes registered in 2023?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out the average estimated value of the bidding processes registered in 2023. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user is asking for an average, which means I'll need to use the AVG() function in SQL. First, I should identify the correct column for the estimated value. From the context, the column is VALOR_ESTIMADO, which is a numeric type, so that's perfect for averaging. Next, I need to filter the records for the year 2023. The column that holds the year is ANO_LICITACAO, which is an integer. So, I'll add a WHERE clause to select only rows where ANO_LICITACAO equals 2023. Now, I need to structure the SQL query. I'll select the average of VALOR_ESTIMADO and give it an alias, maybe 'Average_Estimated_Value' for clarity. The table to select from is LICITACAO, so I'll specify that in the FROM clause. Putting it all together, the query should look something like: select the average of VALOR_ESTIMADO where ANO_LICITACAO is 2023. I should make sure the syntax is correct for SQL Server, using square brackets around column names if necessary, but in this case, the column names don't have spaces, so it's optional. I think that's all. I don't need to join any tables since all the required information is in the LICITACAO table. Also, I should ensure that the query is properly formatted and executable without any errors. </think> SELECT AVG(VALOR_ESTIMADO) AS Average_Estimated_Value FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2023;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
11," ""Which organization conducted the most bidding processes in 2022?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to convert the question ""Which organization conducted the most bidding processes in 2022?"" into an SQL query using the provided database context. Let me start by understanding the question and the context. First, the question is asking about the organization that had the highest number of bidding processes in the year 2022. So, I need to count how many bidding processes each organization had that year and then find out which one had the most. Looking at the database context, the relevant table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database under the dbo schema. The columns provided are: - VALOR_ESTIMADO (NUMERIC(19,3)) - ANO_LICITACAO (INT) - NUMERO_LICITACAO (VARCHAR(255)) - DATA_ABERTURA (datetime2) - ID_MODALIDADE_LICITACAO (VARCHAR(255)) - ID_MODALIDADE_LICITACAO_NOVA (bigint) - STATUS_ANALISE (VARCHAR(100)) - VALOR_ADJUDICADO (NUMERIC(19,3)) - TIPO_ADJUDICACAO (VARCHAR(50)) - ORGAO (VARCHAR(255)) - ID_ENTIDADE (bigint) - ID_TIPO_LICITACAO (bigint) - DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO (datetime) - ID_USUARIO (bigint) - ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE (bigint) From the question, the key columns I need are ANO_LICITACAO to filter for the year 2022 and ORGAO to identify the organization. Since the question is about counting the number of bidding processes per organization, I should group by ORGAO and use a COUNT function on NUMERO_LICITACAO, which is the bidding process number. I also need to ensure that I only count each bidding process once, so using COUNT(DISTINCT NUMERO_LICITACAO) might be necessary if there are duplicates, but I'm not sure if that's the case. However, since each NUMERO_LICITACAO is unique within a year, maybe a simple COUNT is sufficient. The steps I need to take in the SQL query are: 1. Select the ORGAO column. 2. Filter the rows where ANO_LICITACAO is 2022. 3. Group the results by ORGAO. 4. Count the number of bidding processes for each ORGAO. 5. Order the results in descending order based on the count to find the organization with the most processes. 6. Return only the top organization. Putting this together, the SQL query should select ORGAO, count the NUMERO_LICITACAO, filter by ANO_LICITACAO = 2022, group by ORGAO, order by the count descending, and then take the top 1 record. I should also consider if there are any relationships to other tables, but since the question only asks about the organization within the LICITACAO table, I don't think joins are necessary here. So, the final SQL query should look something like: SELECT TOP 1 ORGAO, COUNT(NUMERO_LICITACAO) AS Total FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2022 GROUP BY ORGAO ORDER BY Total DESC; I think that's the correct approach. </think> To determine which organization conducted the most bidding processes in 2022, we can use the following SQL query: SELECT TOP 1 ORGAO, COUNT(NUMERO_LICITACAO) AS Total FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2022 GROUP BY ORGAO ORDER BY Total DESC;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
12," ""How many bidding processes were conducted by each entity in 2024?""","<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking, ""How many bidding processes were conducted by each entity in 2024?"" First, I should look at the provided context. The database is LICON_DEV, schema dbo, and the table is LICITACAO. The columns include ANO_LICITACAO which is the year the bidding process was registered, and ID_ENTIDADE which is the unique identifier of the entity responsible. So, the goal is to count the number of bidding processes each entity conducted in the year 2024. That means I need to filter the data where ANO_LICITACAO is 2024 and then group the results by ID_ENTIDADE. I should use the COUNT function on NUMERO_LICITACAO to get the number of processes. Then, group by ID_ENTIDADE. I'll also alias the count column for clarity. Putting it all together, the SQL query will select the ID_ENTIDADE and the count of NUMERO_LICITACAO where the year is 2024, grouped by ID_ENTIDADE. </think> SELECT ID_ENTIDADE, COUNT(NUMERO_LICITACAO) AS QUANTIDADE_PROCESSOS FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 GROUP BY ID_ENTIDADE;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b

First, I'll look at the context given. The database is LICON_DEV, schema dbo, and the table is LICITACAO. The columns provided don't include a 'legislation' column, so I might be missing something. Maybe the legislation is stored in a different column or another table. Looking at the columns again: VALOR_ESTIMADO, ANO_LICITACAO, NUMERO_LICITACAO, DATA_ABERTURA, ID_MODALIDADE_LICITACAO, ID_MODALIDADE_LICITACAO_NOVA, STATUS_ANALISE, VALOR_ADJUDICADO, TIPO_ADJUDICACAO, ORGAO, ID_ENTIDADE, ID_TIPO_LICITACAO, DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO, ID_USUARIO, ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE. None of these seem to directly relate to legislation. Perhaps the legislation is part of another table related to LICITACAO. The relationships provided mention foreign keys, but they're not specified beyond [table_1], [table_3], etc. Without more details, I can't be sure how legislation is linked. If I assume that there's a related table, say LEGISLACAO, which has a column like NOME_LEGISLACAO (legislation name), and it's connected via a foreign key, maybe ID_LEGISLACAO in LICITACAO. Then I could join the tables and count the rows where NOME_LEGISLACAO is 'Law 14333'. But since the context doesn't provide this information, I might need to adjust. Perhaps the legislation is stored in a column I'm not seeing, or maybe it's part of the MODALIDADE_LICITACAO. If MODALIDADE_LICITACAO has a description that includes the legislation, I could filter on that. Alternatively, maybe the legislation is in the TIPO_ADJUDICACAO or another column. If that's the case, I can directly filter on that column. Since I don't have the exact column, I'll proceed by assuming there's a column like LEGISLACAO in LICITACAO. So, the SQL would count the number of rows where LEGISLACAO equals 'Law 14333'. The correct syntax for SQL Server would use square brackets around the table and column names if they have special characters, but since the names seem standard, I can write it as: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LICITACAO WHERE LEGISLACAO = 'Law 14333'; If the legislation is in a different column or another table, the query would need to join tables, but without that info, I'll stick with this approach. </think> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LICITACAO WHERE LEGISLACAO = 'Law 14333';",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
14," ""For each organization","<think> Okay, so I'm trying to help the user convert their natural language question into an SQL query. The question is about a public transparency system for the Court of Accounts of the State of Acre, specifically the LICON_DEV database. The table in question is LICITACAO, which deals with bidding processes. The user's question is: ""For each organization..."" but it seems incomplete. I need to figure out what they're asking for. Since it's about organizations, I'm guessing they want some aggregated data per organization, maybe the number of bidding processes or the total estimated value. Looking at the columns, ORGAO is the organization responsible. So, I should group by ORGAO. They might want to count the number of processes, so I'll use COUNT. Also, including the year might make sense for annual tracking, so I'll add ANO_LICITACAO to the SELECT and GROUP BY. I'll write a query that selects ORGAO, ANO_LICITACAO, and the count of NUMERO_LICITACAO. Grouping by ORGAO and ANO_LICITACAO will organize the data as required. Using SQL Server syntax, the query should be straightforward without any joins since it's a single table. I think that's it. I'll make sure the syntax is correct and that all columns are properly referenced. </think> SELECT ORGAO, ANO_LICITACAO, COUNT(NUMERO_LICITACAO) AS NUMERO_LICITACOES FROM LICITACAO GROUP BY ORGAO, ANO_LICITACAO",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
15," ""Which bidding processes have an estimated value above 500 thousand reais and are still under review?""","<think> Okay, I need to help the user by converting their natural language question into a SQL query for the given database context. Let's break down the problem step by step. First, the user is asking about bidding processes with an estimated value above 500 thousand reais and that are still under review. So, I need to identify the relevant columns and the correct conditions. Looking at the context, the table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database, schema dbo. The columns provided include VALOR_ESTIMADO, which is the estimated value, and STATUS_ANALISE, which indicates the current status of the analysis. The user wants processes where the estimated value is above 500,000. So, I should use a WHERE clause with VALOR_ESTIMADO > 500000. Next, the processes must still be under review. The STATUS_ANALISE column likely holds the status, so I'll set that to 'EM ANALISE' or similar. I need to confirm the exact status value, but assuming it's 'EM ANALISE', I'll include that condition. I should also consider if there are any other relevant columns to select. The user probably wants all details, so selecting all columns with a SELECT * makes sense. Alternatively, they might only need specific columns, but since they didn't specify, I'll include everything. Putting it all together, the SQL query should select all rows from LICITACAO where VALOR_ESTIMADO is greater than 500,000 and STATUS_ANALISE is 'EM ANALISE'. I'll make sure to use the correct SQL Server syntax and column names. I should also check if there are any relationships or joins needed, but since the user didn't mention other tables, I'll focus solely on LICITACAO. Finally, I'll write the query without any additional explanations, as per the instructions. </think> SELECT * FROM LICON_DEV.dbo.LICITACAO WHERE VALOR_ESTIMADO > 500000 AND STATUS_ANALISE = 'EM ANALISE';",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
16," ""How many bidding processes had exclusive participation in 2024?""","<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to answer the question: ""How many bidding processes had exclusive participation in 2024?"" First, I should understand what ""exclusive participation"" means. It probably refers to a bidding process where only one company or entity participated. So, I'm looking for processes where there was exactly one participant. Looking at the provided context, the table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database under the dbo schema. The relevant columns are: - ANO_LICITACAO (INT): The year the bidding process was registered. - ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE (bigint): The unique identifier of an entity participating in the bidding process. I think I need to count how many times each ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE appears in the LICITACAO table for the year 2024. If a process has only one participant, that means the count of distinct ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE for that process is one. So, I can group the data by the primary key of the bidding process, which I assume is NUMERO_LICITACAO since it's a VARCHAR(255) and likely unique. Then, I can use a subquery to count the number of participants for each process. I'll use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first get all bidding processes from 2024. Then, in the main query, I'll count how many of these have exactly one participant. Wait, but the CTE might not be necessary. Alternatively, I can directly query the LICITACAO table, filter for ANO_LICITACAO = 2024, group by NUMERO_LICITACAO, and count the distinct ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE. Then, I'll count how many groups have a count of 1. So, the steps are: 1. Select from LICITACAO where ANO_LICITACAO is 2024. 2. Group by NUMERO_LICITACAO. 3. For each group, count the number of distinct ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE. 4. Then, count how many of these groups have a count of 1. I think using a subquery or a CTE would be appropriate here. Let me structure the query accordingly. I'll use a subquery to first get the counts per bidding process and then count how many of those are equal to 1. That should give the total number of exclusive processes. </think> To determine how many bidding processes had exclusive participation in 2024, we count the number of processes where only one entity participated. This involves grouping by each bidding process number and counting the distinct participants. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT NUMERO_LICITACAO FROM dbo.LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO = 2024 GROUP BY NUMERO_LICITACAO HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE) = 1 ) AS ExclusiveProcesses;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
17," ""Which were the top 3 organizations that conducted the most bidding processes in the last 5 years","<think> Alright, so I have this question: ""Which were the top 3 organizations that conducted the most bidding processes in the last 5 years."" I need to convert this into an SQL query for the given database context. First, I should identify the relevant table. The context mentions the LICITACAO table, which is about bidding processes. So, that's the table I need to focus on. Next, I need to find the column that represents the organization responsible. The column ORGAO (VARCHAR(255)) fits that description. The question asks for the top 3 organizations based on the number of bidding processes they've conducted. So, I'll need to count the number of records each ORGAO has in the LICITACAO table. Also, it specifies the last 5 years, so I need to filter the records based on the year the bidding process was registered. The column ANO_LICITACAO (INT) holds the year, so I'll use that to get the last five years from the current year. For example, if the current year is 2023, I'll consider years from 2019 to 2023. To get the count, I'll use the COUNT() function on the NUMERO_LICITACAO, assuming each number represents a unique process. Then, I'll group the results by ORGAO and order them in descending order based on the count. Finally, I'll limit the results to the top 3 using TOP 3. Putting it all together, the SQL query should select ORGAO and the count of NUMERO_LICITACAO, filter by ANO_LICITACAO >= (current year - 5), group by ORGAO, order by the count descending, and limit to top 3. I should also make sure to use the correct SQL Server syntax, such as using square brackets for column names if necessary and the TOP clause for limiting results. So, the final query should look something like selecting ORGAO and the count, filtering the year, grouping, ordering, and limiting to top 3. </think> SELECT TOP 3 ORGAO, COUNT(NUMERO_LICITACAO) AS TOTAL_LICITACOES FROM LICITACAO WHERE ANO_LICITACAO >= YEAR(GETDATE()) - 5 GROUP BY ORGAO ORDER BY TOTAL_LICITACOES DESC;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
18," ""Who are the top 5 users who registered the most bidding processes in the last 12 months","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to find the top 5 users who registered the most bidding processes in the last 12 months. Let me break this down step by step. First, I'm looking at the context provided. The table in question is LICITACAO, which is part of the LICON_DEV database under the dbo schema. The relevant columns here are ID_USUARIO, which is the unique identifier for the user who registered the bidding process, and DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO, which is the date when the process was registered and published. The goal is to find the top 5 users based on the number of processes they've registered. So, I need to count how many times each ID_USUARIO appears in the LICITACAO table where the DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO is within the last 12 months from the current date. I should start by selecting the ID_USUARIO and count the occurrences. Using COUNT(ID_USUARIO) makes sense because each entry in LICITACAO represents a bidding process registered by a user. Next, I need to filter the data to only include records from the last 12 months. To do this, I'll use a WHERE clause that checks if DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO is greater than or equal to the current date minus one year. In SQL Server, I can use DATEADD to subtract a year from GETDATE(). After filtering, I'll group the results by ID_USUARIO to aggregate the counts per user. Then, I'll sort these groups in descending order based on the count so that the users with the most registrations are at the top. Finally, since the question asks for the top 5 users, I'll use TOP 5 in the SELECT statement to limit the results to the first five entries after sorting. Putting it all together, I'll structure the query to select the user ID and the count, filter by date, group by user ID, order by the count descending, and then take the top 5 results. I should also ensure that the syntax is correct for SQL Server, using square brackets around column names if necessary, but in this case, the column names don't seem to require them. However, it's good practice to use them to avoid any potential issues with reserved keywords or spaces. So, the final query should look something like selecting the ID_USUARIO and the count of their registrations, filtering the date, grouping by ID_USUARIO, ordering by the count in descending order, and then taking the top 5. </think> To find the top 5 users who registered the most bidding processes in the last 12 months, you can use the following SQL query: SELECT TOP 5 [ID_USUARIO], COUNT([ID_USUARIO]) AS [Count] FROM [dbo].[LICITACAO] WHERE [DATA_CADASTRO_PUBLICACAO] >= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE()) GROUP BY [ID_USUARIO] ORDER BY [Count] DESC; This query selects the top 5 users based on the number of bidding processes they've registered within the last year, ordered by the count of registrations in descending order.",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
19," ""For each participating entity","<think> Okay, so I need to help the user by converting their natural language question into an SQL query for the TCE-AC transparency system. Let's break down the question and the context provided. The user's question is: ""For each participating entity..."" but it seems incomplete. However, looking at the provided context, I can infer that they might be asking for information about each participating entity in the bidding processes. Since the question is cut off, I'll assume they want details like the number of participations, total adjudicated values, average adjudicated values, and the estimated values for each entity. The database is LICON_DEV, schema dbo, and the table is LICITACAO. The relevant columns here are ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE, VALOR_ADJUDICADO, and VALOR_ESTIMADO. I need to group the results by the participating entity. So, I'll use GROUP BY on ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE. For each group, I'll calculate the count of participations (COUNT), the sum of adjudicated values (SUM), the average of adjudicated values (AVG), and the sum of estimated values (SUM again for VALOR_ESTIMADO). I should make sure to use correct SQL Server syntax, so I'll alias the table as L and use square brackets for column aliases that have spaces or special characters. Putting it all together, the SQL query will select the necessary columns and aggregate functions, grouping by the participating entity's ID. </think> SELECT L.ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE, COUNT(L.ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE) AS [Number of Participations], SUM(L.VALOR_ADJUDICADO) AS [Total Adjudicated Value], AVG(L.VALOR_ADJUDICADO) AS [Average Adjudicated Value], SUM(L.VALOR_ESTIMADO) AS [Total Estimated Value] FROM LICITACAO L GROUP BY L.ID_ENTIDADE_PARTICIPANTE",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
20," ""Which bidding processes had estimated values higher than the average of all bidding processes in the same year?""","<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: ""Which bidding processes had estimated values higher than the average of all bidding processes in the same year?"" First, I should understand what the question is asking. It wants to identify all the bidding processes where the estimated value (VALOR_ESTIMADO) is greater than the average estimated value for the same year (ANO_LICITACAO). Looking at the provided context, the relevant table is LICITACAO in the LICON_DEV database. The columns I need are VALOR_ESTIMADO and ANO_LICITACAO. I think the approach here is to compare each bidding process's estimated value to the average of its year. So, I'll need to calculate the average VALOR_ESTIMADO for each year and then select the rows where VALOR_ESTIMADO is greater than this average. To calculate the average, I can use a subquery. The subquery will select the average VALOR_ESTIMADO for each ANO_LICITACAO. Then, in the main query, I'll select all records from LICITACAO where VALOR_ESTIMADO is greater than the average for its respective year. Wait, but how do I get the average for each specific year in the subquery? I think I need to group the subquery by ANO_LICITACAO. So, the subquery will look like SELECT ANO_LICITACAO, AVG(VALOR_ESTIMADO) AS AVG_VALOR FROM LICITACAO GROUP BY ANO_LICITACAO. But in the main query, I need to join this result with the LICITACAO table. Maybe using a JOIN on ANO_LICITACAO and then comparing VALOR_ESTIMADO to AVG_VALOR. Alternatively, I could use a window function to get the average for each year, but I'm more comfortable with subqueries for this case. So, putting it together, I'll write the main SELECT statement, join it with the subquery, and set the condition that VALOR_ESTIMADO is greater than the average. Wait, but in SQL Server, when joining subqueries, I need to give the subquery an alias. So, I'll alias the subquery as AvgValues. I also need to make sure that the columns I'm selecting are correct. The user probably wants to see the relevant details of the bidding processes, so I'll include NUMERO_LICITACAO, ANO_LICITACAO, VALOR_ESTIMADO, and maybe others like ORGAO or DATA_ABERTURA for more context. Let me structure the query: SELECT L.NUMERO_LICITACAO, L.ANO_LICITACAO, L.VALOR_ESTIMADO, L.ORGAO, L.DATA_ABERTURA FROM LICITACAO L JOIN ( SELECT ANO_LICITACAO, AVG(VALOR_ESTIMADO) AS AVG_VALOR FROM LICITACAO GROUP BY ANO_LICITACAO ) AS AvgValues ON L.ANO_LICITACAO = AvgValues.ANO_LICITACAO WHERE L.VALOR_ESTIMADO > AvgValues.AVG_VALOR; Wait, but this will only include years where there is at least one bidding process above average. What if all processes in a year are below average? They won't appear, which is correct because we're only interested in those above average. I think that should work. Alternatively, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) might be more efficient, but the subquery method is straightforward and should suffice. Another thought: Should I handle cases where VALOR_ESTIMADO is NULL? The question doesn't specify, so I'll assume that only non-NULL values are considered. So, the final query should select the necessary columns where the estimated value exceeds the average for its year, joining on the year and filtering accordingly. </think> SELECT L.NUMERO_LICITACAO, L.ANO_LICITACAO, L.VALOR_ESTIMADO, L.ORGAO, L.DATA_ABERTURA FROM LICITACAO L JOIN ( SELECT ANO_LICITACAO, AVG(VALOR_ESTIMADO) AS AVG_VALOR FROM LICITACAO GROUP BY ANO_LICITACAO ) AS AvgValues ON L.ANO_LICITACAO = AvgValues.ANO_LICITACAO WHERE L.VALOR_ESTIMADO > AvgValues.AVG_VALOR;",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
